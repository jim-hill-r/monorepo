# Git LFS Configuration
# 
# This configuration prevents automatic download of LFS files during clone/pull operations.
# LFS files are only downloaded when explicitly requested by the user.
#
# To download all LFS files:
#   git lfs fetch --all
#   git lfs checkout
#
# To download specific files:
#   git lfs fetch --include="path/to/file.pdf"
#   git lfs checkout "path/to/file.pdf"
#
# To download files matching a pattern:
#   git lfs fetch --include="*.pdf"
#   git lfs checkout

	# Exclude all files from automatic fetch during clone/pull
	# This prevents large binary files from being downloaded unless explicitly requested
