              We provide a range of services to help individuals improve their
              reading skills. These services may include one-on-one tutoring or
              small group instruction, using specialized teaching methods and
              techniques to help individuals with dyslexia or other reading
              difficulties. We also offer assessments and evaluations to
              identify an individual’s specific needs and challenges, and then
              develop a personalized plan to address those needs. Additionally,
              we provide training and support for parents, teachers, and other
              professionals who work with individuals with reading difficulties,
              to help them understand how to effectively support and assist
              these individuals.

                Her specialty is in reading remediation programs, meaning there
                is a strong focus on re-training the brain. This is done by
                filling in the gaps a reader has and bringing them up to their
                appropriate level at the pace they need.

                remediation program for struggling readers at the Rosalyn Yalow
                Charter School in the Bronx, New York and trained teachers to
                implement the programs.

              There are several tests that are commonly used to diagnose
              dyslexia, including the Dyslexia Early Screening Test (DEST), the
              Phonological Awareness Test (PAT), and the Comprehensive Test of
              Phonological Processing (CTOPP). These tests are typically
              administered by a trained professional, such as a psychologist or
              speech-language pathologist. In addition to these standardized
              tests, the evaluation process may also include a review of the
              individual’s medical and educational history, as well as an
              assessment of their cognitive abilities and academic achievement.
              The evaluation process is typically tailored to the individual’s
              specific needs and may involve a combination of testing and other
              assessment methods.

                  I just wanted to say thank you to Ms. Smith for all of her
                  hard work and dedication as a reading teacher. My child
                  struggled with reading when they started school, but thanks to
                  Ms. Smith’s patience and guidance, they have made tremendous
                  progress. Ms. Smith’s teaching style is engaging and
                  effective, and she has helped my child develop a love for
                  reading. I am so grateful for all that she has done and highly
                  recommend her as a reading teacher to other parents.

                  I have been incredibly impressed by the work that Ms. Jones
                  has done as a reading teacher. She has a gift for making
                  complex concepts accessible and engaging, and her enthusiasm
                  for reading is contagious. My child has made significant
                  progress in their reading skills thanks to Ms. Jones’ guidance
                  and support. She has also been incredibly patient and
                  understanding, and has provided personalized support that has
                  been tailored to my child’s needs. I am so grateful for
                  everything that Ms. Jones has done, and I would highly
                  recommend her to other parents.
