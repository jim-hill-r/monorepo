# Today's Consumer

### Numerous service accounts
<hr>
<sub>An average consumer has 150 accounts that are hard to manage, secure and close when you no longer are using them. <sup>1</sup></sub>

### Vendor locked
<hr>
<sub>Switching email, music, tax, or other provider is difficult and time-consuming.</sub>

### No interoperability
<hr>
<sub>The power of AI is making connections between different sets of data critical, but consumers have no tools for this.</sub>

### Minimal choice
<hr>
<sub>An app and it's data are linked. Sometimes you want a simple app and sometimes advanced features, but same data. </sub>

<!--
Typical consumer has hundreds of accounts and their data exists silo'ed behind each services moat. If a consumer doesn't like the app they are using, they are locked in because migrating their data is difficult and time-consuming.

Examples:
- Music: Historically, if you didn't like Windows Media Player, you would just download Winamp, but now if you want to switch from YouTube music to Spotify you have to remake all your playlists, redo all your likes

# But why?

### Information is the new currency

Companies will give away apps for free to get your information, so they can sell it to other companies.

### "If the product is free, you are the product."

This old adege is the problem. We need to give control back to the consumers about where, how, and when their data is used.

### Burn down the moat, lower the drawbridge

To do this we need to separate the concerns of user experience and data.

# Separate apps from data

## Apps

- User experience
- Workflows
- Different for everyone

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

 Don't like Windows Media Player,   
download Winamp!   
Not anymore! <span v-mark="{ at: 1, color: 'brown', type: 'highlight' }"> **But why??**  </span>

## Data
- Persistance
- Backups
- TODO

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

Data used to be easy to move from hard drive, to floppy disk, to backups, because they were just files.   
Not anymore! <span v-mark="{ at: 2, color: 'brown', type: 'highlight' }"> **But why??**  </span>
