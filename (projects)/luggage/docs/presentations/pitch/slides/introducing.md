# Luggage

Luggage is a private and portable data platform that inverts the control of data driving better consumer choice.

<br>

Currently, companies own not only your user experience but also your data. Luggage seeks to distrupt this paradigm and return choice back to the consumer. You can pick the apps you want to use and the data storage vendors that those apps will use.
