-TODO: Add a `cast deploy` option to cast project that works on any `iac` project. For cloudflare projects, it should complete the wrangler deploy process. Any secrets should be included in a .env file.
- TODO: Add a `monorepo` workspace project to contain code specific to the high level monorepo functionality. Move the `workflow_tests` project into that workspace.
- TODO: Remove all references to slidev in this monorepo. Slidev is no longer an approved technology.
