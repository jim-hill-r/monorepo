TODO: Create a new project called agent-copilot. Write a Rust binary that calls github copilot to start an agent task similar to the workflow `start-a-new-task.yml`.
TODO: Create a new project called standards. Make it a placeholder for now, but it's purpose is to enforce standards in the monorepo. Maybe put some suggestions as TODOs in the project for how we might enforce standards.
TODO: Create a new project called pane-cloudflare. Put it in the projects folder. This project is a deployment project for deployment the build artifacts from project pane onto cloudflare pages.
