- TODO: Ensure strict no unwrap and no unsafe for clippy is included in repo standards and apply it to all the rust projects.
- TODO: Add a `cast toolchain` command that installs all of the tooling required for a project based on it's cast config. For example, if a project is of type dioxus it needs npm and playwright.
- TODO: Convert the `Cast CI` github workflow to use `cast toolchain` command instead of installing tooling as a part of the workflow. Add a comment to `copilot_instructions` and standards that github workflows should only install rust and all other tooling installation should happen from within cast.
