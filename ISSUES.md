TODO: Create a new project called standards. Make it a placeholder for now, but it's purpose is to enforce standards in the monorepo. Maybe put some suggestions as TODOs in the project for how we might enforce standards.
TODO: Create a new project called pane-cloudflare. Put it in the projects folder. This project is a deployment project for deployment the build artifacts from project pane onto cloudflare pages.
TODO: Implement the project blueeel. Go to blue.eel.education and replicate the functionality there using Dioxus. For the initial implementation, just mock out any api requests by hardcoding the values in the project.
