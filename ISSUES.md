TODO: The github issue Start a New Task should have started a new agent workflow, but it didn't. I think it needs to have @copilot referenced in the body. This issue was created by workflow `start-a-new-task.yml`. Update the workflow to ensure that a new agent task is created when the issue is created.  
TODO: Create a new project called agent-copilot. Write a Rust binary that calls github copilot to start an agent task similar to the workflow `start-a-new-task.yml`.
TODO: Create a new project called standards. Make it a placeholder for now, but it's purpose is to enforce standards in the monorepo. Maybe put some suggestions as TODOs in the project for how we might enforce standards.
TODO: Create a new project called pane-cloudflare. Put it in the projects folder. This project is a deployment project for deployment the build artifacts from project pane onto cloudflare pages.
