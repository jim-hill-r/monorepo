- TODO: For `Cast CD` workflow set the environment variable `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to github secret `GHA_CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_DEPLOY_TOKEN` and ensure it's masked.
- TODO: Remove `deploy.sh` from cloudflare projects as that functionality now exists within `cast deploy`.
- TODO: Add a `monorepo` workspace project to contain code specific to the high level monorepo functionality. Move the `workflow_tests` project into that workspace.
