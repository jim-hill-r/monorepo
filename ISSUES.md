TODO: Add a feature to the standards project that checks every directory in the monorepo and ensures they are snake_case. If they are not, it should add a TODO to the ISSUES.md to rename it. It should also output a json file with details on what percentage of directories are not snake_case and details on which ones are needing updating.
