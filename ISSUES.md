TODO: github workflow start-a-new-task.yml is not working due to error: `Run gh agent-task create -F .github/agent-prompts/start-a-new-task.md
this command requires an OAuth token. Re-authenticate with: gh auth login`. Figure out why the test didn't catch this. Do we need a better testing suite that is not just a shell script?
TODO: Remove the github pages workflow and the index.html that is related to it in the docs directory.   
TODO: Create a new project called pane-cloudflare. Put it in the projects folder. This project is a deployment project for deployment the build artifacts from project pane onto cloudflare pages.
