- TODO: Add a `cast dev` option to cast project that runs an appropriate local dev command. By default this should run `cargo run`. For projects with framework=dioxus, it should run `dx serve`.
- TODO: Create a `cookbook` project that is just a workspace.
- TODO: Move `cookbook_web` project into the `cookbook` project workspace.
- TODO: Add a standard to the standards library enforcing strict typescript and ensure tsconfigs throughout the repo exist and adhere to this standard.
