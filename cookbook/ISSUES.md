# Priority Issues

- TODO: Add a `core` project to this workspace as a rust library. This project will be for storing core business logic and data models.
- TODO: Add a recipe struct to the `core` project that contains recipe information.
- TODO: Add rust traits to the `core` project for reading and writing recipe information.
- TODO: Add a `data_md` project to this workspace that implements the recipe read/write traits and can read and write from markdown files stored in the content folder. The data is made available at build time.
