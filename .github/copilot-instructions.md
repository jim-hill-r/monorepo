## Task Completion Requirements

Before finishing any task that involves code changes:
1. Always run `cast ci` on any projects that have been modified
2. Ensure `cast ci` passes before completing the task
3. Fix any formatting, linting, build, or test failures reported by `cast ci`
4. If changes are made to a workspace project, ensure the workspace configuration supports CI builds (e.g., use `default-members` to exclude platform-specific members that require system dependencies)
