# Priority Issues
- TODO: Add a cast build command. By default, it should just do `cargo build`. Ensure `cast ci` uses the new `cast build` command. 

# Backlog
TODO: Refactor commands to using executor command pattern per [blog post.](https://medium.com/@robjsliwa_71070/crafting-cli-with-oauth-2-0-authentication-multi-tenant-todo-server-in-rust-series-eaa0af452a56)
