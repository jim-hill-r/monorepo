# Priority Issues
- TODO: Add a nice header bar with the Cahokia title and some links to dummy pages
- TODO: Add a sidebar that slides in and out for future controls
- TODO: Stylize the app using earthy colors you might find at an ancient burial mound historical exhibit
- TODO: Write a test that ensures that `dx bundle --platform web --ssg` works and would properly work on a static hosting site
