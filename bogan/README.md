# Bogan

An amazon marketplace clone which is focused on transparency and supply chain information. Restrictions on white-labeling and copy-cats.

Bogan is Algonquin for a quiet tributary or backwater. (ie we provide tranparency to all the tributaries feeding into something like an amazon. We value the little guys and want consumer choice.)

# Notes

- Use existing currencies or consider this as the front for bringing money into a more centralized socialist currency.
